# Giphy Api

- You'll need to read through the Giphy documentation to determine which endpoints you need to complete this app.

- You will also need to register an account in order to get your API Key. This key is used for all of your requests to authenticate your app to Giphy.

# TODO

## MVP

[X] Use the npm library request to hit the giphy api.
[X] Use dotenv package to obscure the api key.
[X] Create a route to request and send back the data to the client.
[X] Test the route with POST Man or in the browser.

## Stretch Goals

- Add the front end to hit the route and display data on the dom.
- Users should also be able to search for a giphy using a keyword. Results should be displayed on the DOM.
- Previous and next buttons for search results (using the Giphy API for pagination).
- Once all the functionality is complete, do some styling with Bootstrap.
